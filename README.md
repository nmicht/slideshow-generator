# Slideshow Generator

Generate Reveal.js slideshows from a set of markdowns files.

This idea is pretty similar to [Prez](https://github.com/byteclubfr/prez), but with the opportunity to keep the markdown sets together by chapters for their publishing on github as a text content.

I commonly write content for learning using markdown files and publish them directly on Github with links to each other to make easier the learning, the problem is when I tried to use the same content to get an slideshow. I have to copy paste pieces on html files for reveal.

The idea is to generate a CLI application that takes those markdown files and generate a lovely presentation using reveal.js without having to split the files or change the organization of them.
